        <p>
          I love creative problem solving, building ambitious websites and
          applications, and cold beer. I also enjoy being around like minded
          people, learning, innovating, and pushing the boundaries of my ever
          expanding comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experiences are wide-ranging and have opened my mind and broadened
          my creativity. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree from the University
          of Wisconsin-Madison, as well as a Full-Stack Wed Development
          certificate from Northwestern University.

          My projects include web applications with dynamic web content, live
          content update, and server side rendering all utilizing the MERN
          stack.
